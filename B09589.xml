            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A New <hi>Test</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND</hi>'s Loyalty.</head>
            <p>I Have often consider'd, but could never yet find a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Reason, why that part of the Nation, (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) should dare appropriate to themselves alone the Principles of true Loyalty, and that no other Church or Communion on Earth can be consistent with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or indeed with any Government.</p>
            <p>This is a Presumption of so high a nature, that it renders the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> a despicable Enemy to rhe rest of Mankind: For what can be more ridiculous than to say, that a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People, calling themselves a <hi>Church,</hi> which cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an <hi>Infallibility</hi> even in matters of Faith, having since their first Institution, made several fundamental changes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship, should, however assume to themselves an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errability</hi> in point of Civil Obebience to the Temporal Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate? Or what can be more injurious, than to aver, that no other <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Community</hi> on Earrh from the rising to the setting Sun, can be capable of this singular Gift of <hi>Loyalty?</hi> So that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> alone (if you have Faith enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her own Testimony) is that Beautiful Spouse of Christ, Holy in her <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> in her Duty to the Supream Magistrate, whom (by a Revelation peculiar to her self) she owns both for her Temporal and Spiritual Head. But I doubt much whether her <hi>ipsa dixit</hi> alone will pass currant with all the Nations of the Universe, without making further search into the veracity of this bold Assertion.</p>
            <p>We will allow them, however (and that's the onely thing in my Opinion, they can value themselves upon) that most of the Members of this <hi>Communion</hi> have been faithful and serviceable to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. during the unhappy Commotions in his Reign: But they must allow us on the other hand, that it was the Ambition of that <hi>Church</hi> to force an universal Uniformity to her <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> occasion'd that War; and the good King both lost his Life and Crown in the Attempt. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192298:3"/> I pray what Work of Super-errogation is it in them, not to have joyn'd with the <hi>common Enemy</hi> to cut their own Throats? Or to have done that which the Law of Nature dictates to every individual in his own defence? he case of the Romanists in those days, was quite different from theirs, for they freely expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed theit Lives and Fortunes in the Kings Service, without any regard or prospect of self-interest: For whether his Majesty lost or won, they expected no benefit by the change. They were to hope for no quarter from the Rebels (for it was never known that any of their Communion serv'd that Party;) and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the King himself seem'd to disown them in all Treaties with the Parliament, and banish'd them at last both from his Court and Army, to comply with the importunities of his own Protestant Party, who would needs have it so. It is much doubted whether those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> had they met with Recompenses of this kind, would have been half so forward to serve a Prince, who instead of cherishing and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, should reject and banish them; though they take never so much pains now to perswade the World, that <hi>Loyalty</hi> is of the Essence of their Religion. Let us but examine the carriage and behaviour of this Church, both in her Infancy, and now in her Old Age, and we shall easily perceive the vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Loyalty of her Members to Catholick Princes, and the Fidelity of Catholicks to Protestant Kings.</p>
            <p>She began her Infancy under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. an Infant King, when that famous Confession of Faith was compil'd in 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. No sooner was <hi>Edward</hi> call'd away, but she endeavour'd with all her might and power to set up a Brat of her own to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Crown, and to exclude Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the only Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Child of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. because she was a <hi>Catholick.</hi> After Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Death, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a known Bastard, rais'd this Prelatick Ptotestancy call'd the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a prop to support the weakness of her Title: And they, no sooner found themselves re-establish'd, than they enacted these bloudy <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> Laws (a sufficient Testimony of their Moderation and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness) <hi>Hang, Draw, and Quarter the Priests of the living
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192298:3"/> God,</hi> from whom they themselves pretend to derive their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Succession: Laws that have been, and are to to this day, abhorr'd and exclaim'd against by all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Reformed Churches of Christendom. <hi>Imprisonment, Banishment,</hi> and <hi>Confiscation</hi> of Goods, were the moderate Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Laws in favour of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Laity, but severely executed in those days. And to crown the extraordinary Loyal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of the Members of this Church, they barbarously murder'd the undoubted Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Queen Dowager of <hi>France,</hi> and the lawful Heir of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> inhumanely denying her a Priest of her own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to assist her in the Agony of Death.</p>
            <p>The greatest Zealots of the <hi>Church of England</hi> will not I hope have the confidence to alledge that this execrable Fact, and the first of the kind, was contriv'd and executed by <hi>Presbterians, Independents, Anabaptists:</hi> Our Records and Histories clearly make out, that the Members of that <hi>Church</hi> were the only Men who then voted in Parliament, who sate in Council, who were the Commissioners delegated to Try and Condemn <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the lawful Queen of <hi>England,</hi> whom they beheaded on a publick <hi>Scaffold,</hi> to the scandal and reproach of <hi>Christianity:</hi> And this done without the least remorse or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no Prelate, Peer, Judge, or Senator of that Communion having ever yet declar'd his resentment against this barbarous Act. <hi>Behold here an incomparable sort of</hi> Loyalty, <hi>to set up the Title of a Bastard, and Murder the Legitimate Heir. And some have affirm'd in print that K</hi> Char. I. <hi>came to the same tragical end, for being too zealously devoted to a</hi> Church, <hi>which prov'd so cruel and treacherous to his Grand mother; &amp; gave the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedent of cutting off a Crown'd Head by the hands of a hangman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore assisting <hi>Ʋsurpers</hi> to invade the Crown, if <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and Executing the Lawful Prince, if persecuting their fellow Subjects with Death and Confiscation of Goods; and if standing out in opposition to their Sovereign, when he is of another Religion;</hi> if these I say, be sufficient Testimonies of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> we must own the Ch. of <hi>England</hi> to have been hitherto unparallel'd in her Duty. But if this be not the true <hi>Test</hi> of Loyal Subjects,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192298:4"/> I doubt our Rock of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> will soon degenerate into a Rock of Scandal, of Disobedience and Rebellion: whereof we need no further Evidence than her present behaviour now in her Old Age, towards our Gracious Sovereign King JAMES II.</p>
            <p>His Sacred Majesty no sooner took Possession of the Throne, than He was Graciously pleased to make a most favourable <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> in behalf of the Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> promising to maintain that Church as it was by Law Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And this early Promise from a Prince, who was known to be always true to his Word, seem'd to elevate their drooping Spirits, and dissipate those dismal Clouds of fearful Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which their ill jealousie was apt enough to conceive of a Prince of the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi> So that it might be rationally expected from a People so Prudent and Loyal as these of the <hi>Church of England</hi> would pass for in the world, to do something on their part, that might express a grateful acknowledgement; which could be no less than the <hi>Repeal</hi> of the <hi>Sanguinary Penal Laws,</hi> and the late Impious <hi>Tests.</hi> The first being purposely Enacted to maintain the <hi>Ʋsurpation</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the last being contriv'd designedly to Exclude the present <hi>King.</hi> But my <hi>Loyal Gentlemen</hi> have been hither to so far out of the right byass, that in lieu of taking off the <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> (which all People expected from them in point of Gratitude, and good Manners) they made a solemn <hi>Address</hi> to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> that none should be imploy'd who were not capacitated by the said <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi> to bear Office Civil and Military. That is to say in short, <hi>Your Majesty must have none either in your Army, or at Court about your person, but such as really believe, &amp; will swear to it that you are an Idolater:</hi> for that's the plain <hi>English</hi> of the <hi>Test.</hi> Now let me ask any indifferent Man, what security can a Prince have who must keep none about him, but such <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that are fully convinc'd in their own Judgment that He is a <hi>Pagan?</hi> If the same People made it Penal heretofore in the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. to call the King a <hi>Papist</hi> or a <hi>Heretick,</hi> upon a supposition that that <hi>True Protestant Subject</hi> could not be Faithful to the King, if he were suspected to be any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192298:4"/> to <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Heresie;</hi> what security can they now give, that the same <hi>Protestants</hi> will de true to a Prince who is a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Papist,</hi> and an <hi>Heathen</hi> to boot, by a new <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> which is of greater force and value than the 39 that went before.</p>
            <p>But (says the <hi>zealous Protestant</hi> of the <hi>Mother-Church) if you repeal the</hi> Test, <hi>you take away the Bulwark that defends the</hi> Ch. <hi>for if that were once demolish'd, the Enemy would rush in, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess all: And it is a delicate innocent</hi> Church, <hi>that cannot he safe but in a fortify'd place.</hi> I must confess it is a great Argument of her Modesty, to own her self weak and unable to subsist without the support of <hi>Parliamentary Laws,</hi> to <hi>Hang, Draw,</hi> and <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> her <hi>Opposers,</hi> and without a co-ercive Power too in her self to <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Excommunicate</hi> all <hi>Recusants</hi> and <hi>Nonconformists. Prayers, Fasting, Mortification of the Flesh,</hi> and other Austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are not, it seems, so proper means to remove the Fears and Jealousies of her render Conscience; she must make use of more powerful Engines for her own security. The <hi>Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> flourished under Persecution for the space of 300 years; and the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of these Kingdoms, have been almost continually suffering these 150 years past: If this new <hi>Protestant</hi> Church be from God, why should they despair of the same Providence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guarded by so many Acts of <hi>Parliament?</hi> Where is the assurance that the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Church (as they call <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hemselves) should have in the assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost, who is to continue with the true</hi> Church <hi>till the consummation of the World?</hi> And what is now become of this celebrated Loyalty to the Temporal Prince, which no People could have in so eminent a degree as those of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> It is very remarkable that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks constantly adhered to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. when he disown'd and rejected them; and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> Protestants, do not now trust King <hi>James</hi> II. when he gives them so many fresh assurances of his Royal Protection: Whereby the vast difference between the Loyalty of the one, and that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is clearly discern'd.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Tests</hi> themselves, it is not my province to shew the Absurdities of them in point of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> For my business is,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192298:5"/> to set forth in its own Colours the extraordinary Loyalty of These Men, who obstinately maintain a <hi>Test,</hi> contriv'd by the <hi>Faction</hi> to usher in the <hi>Bill of Exclusion:</hi> Though by the by, I must hold it a great folly, to say that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not a probable Opinion at least considering the Number and Learning of those who maintain it, which is the best part of <hi>Christendom:</hi> And if it be a probable opinion, it must be a great temerity in any Man to swear there is no such thing. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Real presence of</hi> Christ's <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd by the most Eminent Divines of the <hi>Reformation</hi> and by the greatest Prelates and most Famous Doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I should think that this new <hi>Tenet,</hi> which makes it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to adore the <hi>Divine Body of Christ</hi> (whether there be a <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> or not) must certainly savour more of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> than of <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine. And it is much admir'd (even by some of her own Children,) that the Grave and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron like Church of <hi>England,</hi> which values her self so much for her Antiquity, should be over-fond of a new point of Faith lately broach'd by a famous <hi>Act of Infallibile</hi> English <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> conven'd at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Guided by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> But I doubt there are some <hi>Parliaments</hi> in the World, which will not so easily admit this new <hi>Article</hi> into their <hi>Creed.</hi> Tho' the Church of <hi>England</hi> labours so much to maintain it, as a special Evidence of her singular <hi>Loyalty.</hi>

            <p>So that upon the whole matter the <hi>Loyal Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> must either change her old Principles of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and take example by her <hi>Catholick</hi> Neighbours how to behave her self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Prince who is not of her perswasion; or she must give his Majesty leave not to nourish a Snake in his own Bosom, but rather to withhraw his Royal protection, which was promis'd upon the account of her constant Fidelity: for it is an approv'd Axiom in <hi>Philosophy Cessante causa tollitur effectus;</hi> and we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying of our own, <hi>No longer Pipe no longer Dance</hi> And now let us leave the <hi>holy Mother Church</hi> at liberty to consult <hi>what</hi> new Measures of <hi>Loyalty</hi> she ought to take for her own dear Interest, and for ought I know it may be worth her serious consideration.</p>
